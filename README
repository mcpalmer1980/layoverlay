This program should display the image of a keyboard overlay while a certain button is being held (shift, alt, etc).

It uses evdev, PIL, and PySimpleGUI.

SUDO IS REQUIRED FOR THE EVDEV MODULE TO ACCESS YOUR INPUT DEVICES!!!

You must install PIL and EVDEV for all users so that you can run the script with sudo.

sudo pip install pillow
sudo pip install evdev
sudo python layoverlay.py

Usage:

Once you start the program you must setup your key and image bindings.

1. Select the input device (keyboard)
2. Press the layer/ctrl/alt key you want to bind
3. Click the Add button
4. Click Browse and select an image
5. Press OK to return to the main config window
6. Add any additional bindings you need
7. Click the Start button

A window should flash onto the screen after a second or two. It will reappear when you hold the bound button long enough. The delay may be changed in the main config window.

EXITING: Press a button to make the overlay popup, right click the the image, and then select Exit.

sudo python layoverlay.py config.cfg - load the given config file and start the app in the background. It should popup with an image when you hold a key in your config file, such as the CTRL or ALT button.
