This program should display the image of a keyboard overlay while a certain button is being held (shift, alt, etc).

It uses evdev and pygame. The always on top feature of pygame windows isn't working right now so you must add a rule to your window manager.
I will try to use pysimplegui or some other display module in the near future, and probably a GUI configurator.

SUDO IS REQUIRED FOR EVDEV MODULE TO ACCESS YOUR INPUT DEVICES!!!
You must install pygame for all users so that you can run the script with sudo.
sudo pip install pygame

Usage:

sudo python layoverlay.py - this will start a program that displays all button presses and the device that triggers it. Use this information to build your layoverlay.cfg file.

sudo python layoverlay.py config.cfg - load the given config file and start the app in the background. It should popup with an image when you hold a key in your config file, such as the CTRL or ALT button.

YOU MUST CONFIGURE THE PROGRAM TO BE ALWAYS ON TOP IN YOUR WINDOW MANAGER!!!

<layoverlay.cfg>
    640 480                                 # width, height of window
    /dev/input/event5 /dev/input/event10    # device1, device2 etc
    48 image.png                            # scan code, image.file
    32 image.png                            # scan code, image.file
No comments are allowed in config file.
